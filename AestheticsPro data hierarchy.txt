[Site Name]_data: 	  Main folder which should have all the data. In case of current site, it would be 'Aesthetic Pro_data', in case of Mindbody, it would be 
		  	  'Mindbody_data' and so on.

Client_Details.csv: 	  File with Client ID, all patient demographgic details and perhaps a flag whether Display Picture exists or not.
		          No need for Dp's path saving now, since we know all DPs would be in Client_Attachments/Display_Pictures named in manner 
			  [ClientID_Display Picture]. If flag is True, go to Attachments/Display Pictures/[ClientID_Display Picure].jpg and upload it to AR,
			  if false, skip the upload.

Client_Notes.csv:   	  Client_ID from Client_Details and a Note_Text column for all the text. 1 to many relation between clients and notes. If a client
		   	  has 4 notes. Insert all one by one making 4 rows.


Client_Appointments.csv:  Client_ID from Client_Details.csv and all columns for Appointments from site to be scraped. 1 to many relation between clients and 
			  appointments. If a client has 3 appointments. Insert all one by one making 3 rows in this csv.
			  NOTE: This should have only future appointments.

Client_Attachments:       A folder where all attachments would go


Display_Pitctures:	  A folder where all display pictures would go named in manner [ClientID_Display Picure]. So if DP flag is True, come here, get respective 
			  picture and upload it to AR.

Other_Attachments:	  A folder where all attachments except Display Picture would go. This folder would have sub-folders only for those clients whose documents
			  exist, these sub-folders would be named after [Client_ID], so when uploading documents for a record we simply need to check if a folder 
			  named same as Client_ID exists in Client_Attachments/Other_Attachments, if it does, upload all files to AR, if not, no documents to 
			  be uploaded for that client.

[Client_ID] folder:	  This folder should contain all attachments except the Display Picture. Could be photos, could be consent forms in pdf/docx, could be anything
			  else that's discussed to be moved. All documents/photos would be placed in this folder a particular client after renaming as per rules if
			  need be.
